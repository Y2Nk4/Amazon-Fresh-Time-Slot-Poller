## DISCLAIMER about "disappearing" slots
No guarantee that slots will be found and/or that slots will work. Often you will select a slot but the page will refresh and the slot will disappear. These phantom slots are very common and are unfortunately in Amazon's control, not mine.  Eventually a slot should work. Some users report success of after 20+ tries. Wishing you resilience and hope! Feel free to post concerns in the Issue section.
